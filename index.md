# About me


 I am a graduate of the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/) and a PhD Candidate at [CeNDEF](https://cendef.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam supervised by [Florian Wagener](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/f.o.o.wagener/f.o.o.wagener.html) and [Jan Tuinstra](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/t/u/j.tuinstra/j.tuinstra.html). 
 
 My primary research fields are environmental economics and climate change, political economy, and applied game theory. 
 
 In my [job market paper](https://sebastiantk.com/assets/political_environmental.pdf), I study how uncertainty about how long carbon pricing will remain in force affects investment in clean electricity. Two parties alternate in government, and an exogenous carbon price is implemented under the green party and suspended under the brown party. This duration risk leads firms to postpone irreversible investment in clean capacity, which slows deployment, keeps fossil generation higher during the transition, and raises cumulative emissions. More frequent alternation reduces worst-case emissions by lowering the probability of long periods without policy, even when average policy intensity is unchanged.
