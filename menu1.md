 In this paper, firms in a network of Cournot economies learn about the intercept of the demand curve using past sales history. I decompose the learning process into economically interpretable components and find that learning aggregate quantities happens at a faster rate both within markets and within firms. This speed depends on the network topology and elasticity of demand. The slowest learning task is for a firm to find out how to distribute a correct aggregate amount between markets, which is why individual quantities converge at a slower rate. This convergence rate is constant for all sufficiently connected networks and is independent of the elasticity of demand. Increasing the density of a network has a nonlinear effect on the convergence speed of aggregate quantities as for a low level of connectivity information takes longer to disseminate.
